    <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turn marking either 
    an X or an O on the grid with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, 
    or diagonally, before the opponent does. Pretty simple right?</p>
