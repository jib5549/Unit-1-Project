1) first, start by identifying constants, variables, cached element references, event listeners, and functions for the project
    1.1) setting the players to "1" and "-1" so its able to switch turns with a simple multiplication of *= -1.
    1.2) there are eight ways to win tic-tac-toe and let's declare it as winConditions and put it in as an array so it can iterate through each to check after each turn

2) define required variables used to track the state of the game.
    2.1) let's use a board 2d array to represent the boxes in the board
    2.2) find a way to keep track of who's turn it is
    2.3) it should be able to tell if there is a winner, loser, or a tie in the game and it should always check after each turn

3) when the app loads it should:
    3.1) initialize the state variables
        3.1.1) all the boards are going to be null in the beginning because when the game starts its a clean board
        3.1.2) since it's always going to be "1" turn I will assign it as "X" and wherever he/she clicks on the board, and the box, will have the "X" appear on the spot.
    3.2) render those values to the page
    3.3) wait for the user to click a square
        3.3.1) figure out the index of each box so we can link it and see which one was clicked


5) handle a player clicking a clear button, music button, and restart button.
    5.1) clear button is used after each round until there is a winner
    5.2) for people who don't like music in the background create a button that will turn on/off on clicking
    5.3) restart button is ONLY when there is a winner that won three rounds total.
